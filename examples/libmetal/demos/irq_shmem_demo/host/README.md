# IRQ Shared Memory Demo â€“ Host Side

The host application publishes timestamped packets into a shared-memory window,
signals the remote processor via IPI, and waits for the echoed payloads to
measure round-trip latency. After the final message it sends a `"shutdown"`
marker to stop the remote task.
